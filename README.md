# moofactory-notifications
Invitations, reminders and notifications are essential elements in strengthening learner engagement.

moofactory-Notifications enable administrator on moodle to:

• Create as many message templates as needed. HTML messages that can include text, merge fields, images.

• Activate, in a simple way, on the platform:

o    Course registration notifications

o    Class event notifications

o    Non-connection reminders

Recall times can be set for each of these cases (up to 3 reminders).

 

Moofactory-Notifications also allows trainers, on course level, to:

• Decide whether or not to activate the notifications set by the administrator

• Vary the time frames and the number of recalls

These settings can also be managed more precisely on the activity level.

 

The administrator defines the general rules governing notifications in the platform, and the trainer decides whether to use these general rules or to apply his/her own.

This way, with the moofactory-Notifications plugin, both are able to easily set up customizable messages, on both the substance and the form.

Ease, efficiency and aesthetics are eventually combined to serve the notifications management.
